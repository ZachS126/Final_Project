Sorry this is such a mess, most of these files are junk

IMPORTANT FILES:

Ovary: 
  The entire TumorMet Ovarian Cancer Tissue dataset
  The dataset used for our analysis is located in Ovary/Metabolites-based/Metabolites-based_tissue
  Additional information about the graphs used can be found in Ovary/sample_sheet.tsv
    Also included are IDs that allow you to match the sample information to the graph filename
  The dictionary_ids are for a different data set
    That one took me a while to figure out

Methods.ipynb:
  All code used to generate the methods
  It is in a jupyter notebook, with different cells corresponding to different methods
  Code is commented, although not perfectly. Hammingish distance will take considerable time to run at a higher number of realizaitions.
