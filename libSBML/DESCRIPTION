Author: LibSBML Team <libsbml-team@googlegroups.com>
Maintainer: Frank Bergmann <fbergman@caltech.edu>
Depends: R (>= 1.8.0), methods
Description: LibSBML is an open-source programming library designed to help you 
	read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data 
	streams.  It is not an application itself (though it does come with 
	example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own 
	applications. LibSBML 5.20.2 understands SBML Level 3 Version 1 and before, 
	as well as the draft SBML Level 2 Layout proposal by Gauges, Rost, 
	Sahle and Wegner.  It's written in ISO C and C++ but can also be 
	used from C#, Java, MATLAB, Octave, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
